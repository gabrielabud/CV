## Gabriela Budeanu

Having previously held positions in investment management (managing and analysing portfolios of government and corporate bonds), I am now looking to switch careers into the tech industry as a **Full Stack Junior Developer**. My main focus is on adopting a technical mindset that will allow to quickly progress further into other programming languages.

Despite being a high achiever and having progressed in my career in investment management, I started to realise that the effort I was putting in was not proportionally reflected in my performance. This is due to many factors whose effects cannot be always predicted.

I find the tech industry to be a far more dynamic and challenging environment, where the connection between hard work and performance is much clearer.

My decision to now pursue a software developer career is also connected to the time I spent programming during high school. I am now strongly motivated to reverse my decision and put my efforts towards pursuing a career as a software developer.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

**Analytical thinking**<br/>
Throughout the seven years I spent in leading financial institutions both in London and Bucharest, I have attained strong analytical thinking and advanced financial skills.

While holding the role of Credit Strategy Analyst at Legal & General Investment Management, I provided investment recommendations via building quantitative modelling Excel based research within the credit universe (e.g. corporate bond performance).

As a Portfolio Manager at Raiffeisen Bank, in the process of identifying trade ideas I have acquired solid research skills by analysing macroeconomic factors, industry drivers and individual issuers' fundamentals such as leverage or cash flow generation.

**Communication skills**<br/>
In my previous professional roles, I had the chance to not only fine-tune my communication skills and ease of interacting with clients at all levels of an organisation, but also my presentation skills through drafting and sustaining presentations for audiences larger than 50 people.

**Working under pressure** <br/>
By working in fast-paced environments where investment conditions were constantly changing, I developed the ability to work under pressure and to multitask.
